    <summary><h3>ðŸ“‘ About me</h3></summary>
    I feel lucky by forming part of this vast and always expanding field that is technology and although my initial passion was physics, 
    once I started computer science in college, I fell right into its wonders. Being able to use this tools that technology provides 
    to improve your understanding of the world or to help pleople is breathtaking.<br><br>
    My firsts steps were learing about the hardware and later on, the software of what compose our today's computers.<br>
    I've found myself with great challenges while developing my intuition in programming and nowadays I feel most comfortable developing
    backend applications with Spring although I feel very curious about frontend developing so Full stack, here I come!<br><br>
    I wouldn't be enjoying this profession if it weren't for all the people that supported me behind the curtains so to all of them:
    Thank you!
